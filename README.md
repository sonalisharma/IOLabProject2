Project title: Instagralbums


Team member names:

Team member responsibilities:
Arthur - worked with the Instagram API to display the most recent public photos; handled final integration and debugging of team members' code
Carinne - created page2 to display the photos of the selected album; worked on CSS styles and presentation
Sonali - created the droppable albums and worked with the dictionary API to check spelling of tag names


Project description:
Instagralbums allows the user to create albums and drag/drop Instagram photos into them. The albums are user-defined, but during creation the names of the albums are checked against a dictionary to correct spelling/provide suggestions. Individual photos are saved as Delicious bookmarks tagged with the album name so they can be re-accessed using a Delicious login.

Our approach: We met as a group to determine the concept for the project and then divided the tasks into three discreet segments, which we worked on individually. We reconvened midway through the project to share our progress and also used github to collaborate and share work.


Which of Cory Doctorow's strawmen did you try to address:
People are stupid. By providing a dictionary check of tag names, we ensured that users entered real words, spelled correctly.
