=============

Flickr Circles allows the user to create G+ style circles and drag/drop Flickr photos into them. The circles are user-defined, but during creation the names of the circles are checked against a dictionary to correct spelling/provide suggestions. Afterwards, individual circles can be saved as Delicious bookmarks tagged with the circle name, # of photos, or other info.
