Instagram Albums allows the user to create albums and drag/drop Instagram photos into them. The album names (tags) are user-defined, but during creation the names of the albums are checked against a dictionary to correct spelling and provide suggestions. Afterwards, individual albums can be saved as Delicious bookmarks tagged with the album name, # of photos, or other info.
