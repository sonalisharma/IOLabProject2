###Project description
Instagralbums allows the user to create albums and drag/drop Instagram photos into them. The albums are user-defined, but during creation the names of the albums are checked against a dictionary to correct spelling/provide suggestions. Individual photos are saved as Delicious bookmarks tagged with the album name so they can be re-accessed using a Delicious login.

###Our approach
We met as a group to determine the concept for the project and then divided the tasks into three discrete segments, which we worked on individually. We reconvened midway through the project to share our progress and also used github to collaborate and share work.

###Which of Cory Doctorow's strawmen did you try to address
People are stupid. By providing a dictionary check of tag names, we ensured that users entered real words, spelled correctly.

This project was based on controlled vocabulary where users create tags, which are often misspelled or are redundant. This is an attempt to solve the vocabulary problem by ensuring the following:

1) Users place items in predefined categories to ensure uniformity and reduce redundancy. In our application we display the already existing photo albums to the user, in which user can drag and drop additional
photographs from Instagram.  
2) User is given an option to create a new album, however to ensure that there are no misspelt names, the name are checked against a dictionary and the user is allowed to create only meaningful names.

###Bugs/quirks we're aware of
-Cannot test albums names that have multiple words. While testing the names in loop the javascript was giving an error. This can be implemented as a future enhancement.  
-The "create album" modal isn't a true modal (you can still click the stuff around it). Couldn't quite get the true modal working, would be able to sort it out with a bit more time.  
-Originally, we wanted to make the "Create New Album" box droppable, but ran into some issues with that based on how we implemented the album creation.  
-There's currently no way stop Instagralbums from re-loading photos you have already added to an album before when doing a refresh on the API.
