Instagralbums allows the user to create albums and drag/drop Instagram photos into them. The albums are user-defined, but during creation the names of the circles are checked against a dictionary to correct spelling/provide suggestions. Individual photos are saved as Delicious bookmarks tagged with the album name so they can be re-accessed using a Delicious login.
